# 🛡️Footprinting and Network Scanning using Nmap | Ethical Hacking Project

The project explores the initial phases of ethical hacking — footprinting and network scanning, using tools such as WHOIS, Google Dorking, and Nmap. It demonstrates both passive and active reconnaissance techniques in a controlled lab environment.

⚙️ Key Objectives:-

🔷 Understanding how attackers gather information about target systems

🔷 Performing port scans, service version detection, and OS fingerprinting

🔷 Documenting scan results with formal observations and screenshots

🔷 Reinforcing ethical boundaries in cybersecurity practices
